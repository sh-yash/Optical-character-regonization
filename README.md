# Optical-character-regonization
-Train your machine with your very own characters and get the result for your recogniztion
-Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed,
handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo

## Successful Approach: Training and Predicting using Machine Learning
### The last approach was to train my own Machine Learning model. This solution required the following:
### Singling out each digit from an image
### Choosing appropriate feature extraction to apply on each digit
### Choosing a multi-class classifier
Input/data pre-processing, feature engineering, and data preparation lie at the heart of any Machine Learning based solution. The choice of which Machine Learning classifier to use is an important step, however, its success lies in the above mentioned.
